## To make the tagoverview addon functional in Kodi v17 & v18 (Krypton & Leia):

* Accounted for 3 digit database numbers (MyVideos116.db)
* Replaced deprecated functions (e.g. StringCompare)
* Replaced .xml language file with .po
* Smaller UI updates

## Additional improvements:
* Added mouse support (previously selection could only occur with Enter button).  
* Added support for stacked movies (e.g. disk1, disk1) (previously would open Overview instead of tag selector) 
* Updated sorting.  Put selected tags on top of list.  Alphabetized movie/show lists (still doesn't account for articles or sort titles)
* Added context menu, under Manage, for people who don't want to map to a button.  
* Added delete confirmation when deleting entire tag.
* Put Tag name on movie/show window header when adding to a tag from the Overview screen.

## Notes / warnings:
* Tested on Kodi 21 Omega
* The addon was originally coded for Confluence skin and matches that style.  Should still work in other skins (tested in Estuary).
* Be careful when using mouse to select.  If you moved your mouse quickly before the next menu appears, selection may have changed.
